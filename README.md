# Efficient Summarization of Scientific and Medical Literature

This project aims to develop an efficient method for summarizing scientific and medical research papers using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model automatically generates concise summaries of medical abstracts while preserving key clinical details such as **conditions, interventions, and outcomes**.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Scientific literature is growing exponentially, making it difficult for researchers and clinicians to stay updated. This project explores the use of transformer-based models (e.g., **Qwen**) to automatically summarize long medical and scientific texts.

### Key Features
- Summarizes long abstracts into 3â€“4 sentences.
- Keeps key clinical information intact.
- Includes fallback generation in case of incomplete summaries.


## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Transformers / Qwen models**
- **PyTorch**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **ROUGE** for evaluation metrics
