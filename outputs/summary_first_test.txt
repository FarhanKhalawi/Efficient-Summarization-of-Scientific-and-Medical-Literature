Looking at this abstract, it describes a sheep model study where they exposed sheep to Ascaris allergen. The key points I need to extract: they created a chronic allergic model by repeated tracheally instilling Ascarist antigen until reactive sheep (Group C) showed stable 3x increase in airway resistance (RL) compared to controls. They compared Group C (reactive, n=6) to Group B (non-reactive, 3 sheep) and Group A (saline control, 8 sheep). Measurements included RL, FRC via two techniques, lung mechanics, and BAL cell counts.
