Looking at the abstract, it describes a sheep model of allergic airWAY disease. The researchers exposed sheep to Ascaris allergen until they developed chronic inflammation. They divided the sheep into three groups: Group A (control, saline only), Group B (non-reactive), and Group C (reactive with stable increased airway resistance). Key measurements included airway mechanics (RL, FRC), lung function tests (plethysomography, helium rebreathe), and BAL analyses (cell counts, protein levels).
