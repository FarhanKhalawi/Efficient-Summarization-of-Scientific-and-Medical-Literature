Looking at the abstract, I see it describes a sheep model of allergic airWAY disease. The key elements are: nine sheep were exposed to Ascaris allergen until they developed stable increased airway resistance (RL). They were divided into groups: Group C (6 reactive sheep) had RL at 3x control, Group B (3 non-reactive) and Group A (8 saline controls). The study measured RL, FRC (trapping volume), UP resistance, and BAL cell counts.
