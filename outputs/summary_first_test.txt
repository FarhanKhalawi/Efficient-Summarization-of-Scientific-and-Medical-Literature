Looking at the abstract, it describes a sheep model of allergic airWAY disease. The researchers exposed nine sheep (Group C) to Ascaris allergen until they developed stable increased airway resistance (RL) at three-times control level. They compared these reactive sheep to non-reactive sheep (group B) and saline-exposed controls (group A). Key measurements included RL, FRC, airway resistances, and BAL cell counts.
