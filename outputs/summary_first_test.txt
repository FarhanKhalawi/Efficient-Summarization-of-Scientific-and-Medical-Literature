Hmm, the user wants me to summarize a medical abstract about an animal study on allergic airways disease. They've provided very specific instructions: I need to summarize in 4 sentences max, include only key clinical facts, copy numeric values verbatim, and avoid any introductory phrases. The output must be wrapped in <summary> tags with nothing else.
