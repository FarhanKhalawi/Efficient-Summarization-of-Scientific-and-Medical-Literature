Key findings included complications such as postoperative hematoma, infection, vocal cord palsy, lower facial weakness, and nerve-related issues, with certain risks occurring in a low frequency. The study highlights that while VNS implantation is relatively safe, certain complications can occur, and a LT (longitudinal) perspective is crucial."
